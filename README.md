### :white_check_mark: React Project with Backend on AWS Using GraphQL

I'd been wanting to use AWS for quite a while and in this instance, I signed up for an account and begin to explore the documentation for Amplify and GraphQL. Learned how to use AWS to serve the backend of my React To Do List App and store data in GraphQL. 

It was really fun to see all the databases you could work with and languages to implement and engineer all different solutions. 

</br></br>

### :mortar_board: Main Learning Points:

- First time using AWS and GraphQL to build and provision the back end of a project, so learned to take it slow and study documentation/google when needed. 

- Learned about breaking the problem down, planning and tackling one bit of the app at a time. 

- Make sure to console log a lot and read errors/ not be afraid of them when they come up.
